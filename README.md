**Expense Management System**
This repository contains the complete code for an Expense Management System designed to help employees upload and track their expense statuses in a web-based application.

Features:

Expense Upload & Tracking: Employees can easily upload their expenses and monitor their current status, providing a clear and organized way to manage financial activities.
Uploaded Bills or Receipts Storage: Uploaded bills or receipts are securely stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, ensuring reliable and scalable storage for all files.
Backend Development: Built using Java Spring Boot, this backend implementation ensures the system is both scalable and robust, providing a strong foundation for handling multiple users and large amounts of data.
Frontend Development: Designed with React.js, the frontend offers an intuitive and responsive user interface, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience across all devices.
Authentication & Security: The application is secured with JWT-based authentication, providing secure access for users while ensuring data integrity throughout the platform.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Java Spring Boot
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone <repository_url>

Setup the Backend:
Navigate to the backend directory of the project.

Open the application.properties or application.yml file (depending on your setup).

Add your database connection details in the properties file:

Example for MySQL:

properties
Copy
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<db_host>:<db_port>/<db_name>
spring.datasource.username=<your_db_username>
spring.datasource.password=<your_db_password>
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
Replace the placeholders:

<db_host>: The host of your database (e.g., localhost or an IP address).
<db_port>: The port number your database is running on (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).
<db_name>: The name of your database.
<your_db_username>: Your database username.
<your_db_password>: Your database password.
Example for PostgreSQL:

properties
Copy
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<db_host>:<db_port>/<db_name>
spring.datasource.username=<your_db_username>
spring.datasource.password=<your_db_password>
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
Run the Backend:

Ensure you have the necessary Java version (e.g., Java 11 or higher).
Use Maven to build and run the Spring Boot application:

mvn spring-boot:run


Setup the Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.
Install dependencies using npm:

npm install

Run the Frontend: Start the frontend application with:

npm start

Access the Application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port the frontend runs on).
The backend should be available at http://localhost:8888 (or whichever port the backend runs on).
Authentication:

The application uses JWT-based authentication to secure access. Ensure your JWT token is passed in the headers when accessing protected routes.
